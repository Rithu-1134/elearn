            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Concurrency in Java refers to the ability of a program to run multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance by utilizing available system resources effectively. Java provides built-in mechanisms and libraries to support concurrent programming, allowing developers to create applications that can perform multiple operations concurrently.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Thread</h3>
            <p>A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Java threads are lightweight processes that share memory and resources of the parent process. Threads can be created by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.</p>
            
            <h3>Thread States</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New: When a thread is created but not yet started.</li>
                <li>Runnable: When the thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.</li>
                <li>Blocked: When a thread is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method.</li>
                <li>Waiting: When a thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.</li>
                <li>Timed Waiting: When a thread waits for a specified period of time.</li>
                <li>Terminated: When a thread has completed execution or terminated abnormally.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Thread Synchronization</h3>
            <p>Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource (like variables or methods) at any given time. This prevents data inconsistency and thread interference.</p>

            <h3>Concurrency Utilities</h3>
            <p>Java provides several classes and interfaces in the java.util.concurrent package to facilitate concurrent programming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Executor Framework: Simplifies the execution of tasks asynchronously in a thread pool.</li>
                <li>Concurrent Collections: Thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, etc.</li>
                <li>Atomic Variables: Provides atomic operations on single variables (AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean, etc.).</li>
                <li>CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier: Synchronization aids for controlling the execution flow of threads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Examples of Using Concurrency in Java</h2>
            <h3>Example 1: Creating and Starting Threads</h3>
            <pre><code>public class ThreadExample extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadExample thread = new ThreadExample();
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    }
}</code></pre>

            <h3>Example 2: Using Runnable Interface</h3>
            <pre><code>public class RunnableExample implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new RunnableExample());
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    }
}</code></pre>

            <h3>Example 3: Synchronized Method</h3>
            <pre><code>public class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronizedCounter counter = new SynchronizedCounter();

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount()); // Should print 2000
    }
}</code></pre>
