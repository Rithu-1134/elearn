            <h2>Definition and Overview</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

        <section id="history" class="course-section">
            <h2>History of Java</h2>
            <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code is compiled into bytecode that can be run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Everything in Java is treated as an object, promoting code reuse and modular structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Familiar:</strong> Java is designed to be easy to use and accessible, with a syntax that is clean and understandable.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors and runtime checking, making it more robust. It also provides a secure platform for developing applications with built-in security features.</li>
                <li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> Java has built-in support for multithreaded programming, which allows you to build applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> The use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers allows Java applications to perform at an almost native level.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong> Java has a comprehensive set of APIs that makes it easy to work with resources across a network.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Java Architecture</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Java Development Kit (JDK):</strong> A software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets.</li>
                <li><strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> Provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.</li>
                <li><strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</strong> An abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. It converts Java bytecode into machine language and executes it.</li>
            </ul>
