            <h2>1. Machine Learning Definition</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can automatically learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2" class="course-section">
            <h2>2. Key Concepts in Machine Learning</h2>
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regression: Predicting continuous outputs (e.g., predicting house prices).</li>
                <li>Classification: Predicting discrete outputs (e.g., spam detection).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the algorithm learns patterns and structures within the data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).</li>
                <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in data (e.g., principal component analysis).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agents: Autonomous systems that interact with an environment.</li>
                <li>Reward Function: Defines the goal or performance measure for the agent.</li>
            </ul>
