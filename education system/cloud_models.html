            <h2>1. Public Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
            In the public cloud model, services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple organizations. The cloud service provider owns and operates the infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking equipment.</p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-Tenant Architecture: Resources are shared among multiple customers. Each customer's data and applications are isolated from others.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.</li>
                <li>Cost-Efficiency: Typically follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where customers pay only for the resources they use.</li>
                <li>Maintenance-Free: The cloud provider manages and maintains the infrastructure, including updates and security patches.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS): Offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, and databases.</li>
                <li>Microsoft Azure: Provides services for computing, analytics, storage, and networking.</li>
                <li>Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Includes services for computing, data storage, machine learning, and more.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Startups and small businesses that need scalable resources without significant upfront investment.</li>
                <li>Applications with variable workloads or unpredictable usage patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="section2" class="course-section">
            <h2>2. Private Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The private cloud model involves cloud services being maintained on a private network and used exclusively by a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.</p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single-Tenant Architecture: Resources are dedicated to a single organization, providing enhanced control and security.</li>
                <li>Customization: Organizations can customize the cloud environment to meet specific needs and compliance requirements.</li>
                <li>Control: Greater control over infrastructure, security, and data management.</li>
                <li>Cost: Higher upfront and ongoing costs compared to public cloud, as the organization bears the expense of hardware and maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>VMware Cloud Foundation: Provides an integrated software-defined data center (SDDC) for private cloud deployments.</li>
                <li>OpenStack: An open-source platform for building private clouds.</li>
                <li>Microsoft Azure Stack: An extension of Azure that brings cloud services to on-premises environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizations with strict data privacy and regulatory requirements.</li>
                <li>Businesses needing customized solutions that are not feasible in a public cloud environment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="section3" class="course-section">
            <h2>3. Hybrid Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The hybrid cloud model combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model offers flexibility and optimized resource utilization.</p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integration: Seamlessly integrates public and private cloud environments, enabling data and applications to move between them.</li>
                <li>Flexibility: Allows organizations to use public cloud resources for non-sensitive workloads and private cloud for critical applications and data.</li>
                <li>Cost Optimization: Balances cost and performance by leveraging public cloud resources for scalability while maintaining sensitive data in a private cloud.</li>
                <li>Complexity: Requires careful management and coordination between different cloud environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Azure Arc: Extends Azure management and services to on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments.</li>
                <li>AWS Outposts: Brings AWS services and infrastructure on-premises to support hybrid deployments.</li>
                <li>Google Anthos: Manages and deploys applications across multiple clouds and on-premises environments.</li>

        <section id="section4" class="course-section">
            <h2>4. Community Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The community cloud model involves sharing cloud infrastructure among several organizations with similar interests or requirements, such as security, compliance, or regulatory concerns.</p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shared Infrastructure: Resources are shared among a specific community of organizations.</li>
                <li>Cost Sharing: Costs are distributed among the community members, making it more affordable than a private cloud.</li>
                <li>Collaboration: Enables collaboration and data sharing among organizations with similar needs.</li>
                <li>Governance: Managed either by the community members themselves or by a third-party provider.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
