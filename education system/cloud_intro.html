            <h2>1. What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition and Scope of Cloud Computing:</strong><br>
            Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or data centers, users can access these resources on-demand from a cloud service provider.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service:</strong> Users can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.</li>
                <li><strong>Broad Network Access:</strong> Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Pooling:</strong> Providers’ computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Capabilities can be scaled up or down quickly based on demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability. This allows for pay-as-you-go models.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="section2" class="course-section">
            <h2>2. Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Deployment Models:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple organizations. <br>Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</li>
                <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Services are maintained on a private network and used exclusively by a single organization. <br>Deployment: Can be on-premises or hosted by a third-party provider.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Cloud:</strong> Shared infrastructure for a specific community with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Service Models:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. <br>Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure. <br>Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure App Services.</li>
                <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. <br>Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduces the need for upfront capital expenditure and lowers IT costs by using a pay-as-you-go model.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Easily scale resources up or down based on demand without needing to invest in physical infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility and Collaboration:</strong> Access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling remote work and collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>Disaster Recovery and Backup:</strong> Cloud providers offer robust disaster recovery and backup solutions to ensure data integrity and availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Updates and Maintenance:</strong> Cloud service providers handle regular maintenance and updates, ensuring that the latest features and security patches are available.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Leading cloud providers invest heavily in security measures and compliance certifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Challenges of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> Data breaches and unauthorized access can be a concern. Users must trust the cloud provider's security measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Downtime and Reliability:</strong> Dependence on the cloud provider’s reliability and uptime. Potential issues with service outages and downtime.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Transfer and Bandwidth Costs:</strong> Costs associated with transferring large amounts of data to and from the cloud. Network bandwidth limitations can affect performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor Lock-In:</strong> Difficulty in migrating applications and data between different cloud providers due to proprietary technologies and standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Management and Governance:</strong> Requires proper management and governance to ensure effective utilization and control over cloud resources.</li>
            </ul>
